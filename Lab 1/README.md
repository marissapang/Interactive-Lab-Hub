# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

**The interaction for my device takes place in the home, usually of someone who spends a significant amount of time studying or working from home. The interactive device is targeted at individuals who, perhaps during the pandemic, have fallen into a habit of sitting at their desk for extended periods without getting up for water, exercise, or other breaks -- actions important to both mental and physical health.**

**This interactive device will take the form of a light fixture that works similarly to an alarm clock. The device will light up in various aesthetically pleasing colors that sometimes flicker in patterns, serving as a gentle way of reminding an individual to drink water, move around, or perform other wellness breaks throughout the day. The user can press a snooze-like button on top of the device (which would change the color and/or flicker pattern of the device)to indicate that they have completed a certain task.**

**The device is designed to cater to the wellness needs of a single user. It could also be used by multiple people who spend time in the same room and hope to accomplish the same wellness goals together, perhaps as a means of mutual enforcement or team-building.**

**This device seeks to help its user(s) accomplish their wellness goals by sending positive (in this case, cute-looking) reminder signals. Instead of interacting with typical mobile alarms/reminders that can be jarring or cause an interruption to one's work flow, users would be reminded of their wellness goals by more a gentle, aesthetically-pleasing light. The goal of the users of this device is, in this case, predominantly to use this device as an aid to live in a way that is more in accordance with their wellness values.**



Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

![Lab1_Storyboard](https://github.com/marissapang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/images/lab1_storyboard.jpg)

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

**My group found the non-intrusive, non-interrupting nature of the device to be creative and valuable. It was suggested that using only colors as a way of showing different reminders can become restrictive when a person has two wellness goals, or concurrent goals such to both drink water AND do 10 pushups every 30 minutes.**


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**When acting out the interaction, it felt good to see a light in a pretty color on my desk. One of my wellness goals is to drink water more often. However, I noticed that I did not always come back immediately to my desk after drinking water, and thus ended up not recording my water intake well whenever I was away from the desk (eg. when I was heading out for dinner, when I was cooking, or when I was on the couch).**

**When "snoozing" the light to indicate that I have drank water, I noticed that there was no positive reward after the fact. My light has simply gone from a nice-looking blue color back to a nice-looking pink color (my color of choice for when I have no wellness reminders). I think if there was a way to record how many wellness goals I had accomplished each day (perhaps through small icons on the larger device), I'd feel more excited about ticking off my wellness goals.** 


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

**For my device, I wanted to use the flickering of light (in addition to the color of light) to send different signals. It would be great if there is a way to add flashing effects to the tinkerbell interface)**

**I am a big fan of how dragging my mouse over the color picker can change the color in a seamless fashion. It created a great user experience for me, where I felt I could use the tool in a freeing, whimsical fashion. I personally feel that the experience would be even better if instead of a gradient for each color, we could get to all colors/hues by dragging our mouse through an extended version of a color picker that has all colors and hues. Perhaps something that looks like an extension of the color-picker below, where maybe as one moves further towards the edge the tones of each hue would gradually darken. However, this interface would not work well on mobile devices with smaller screens.**

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**When trying to setup the device, we started with iPhone screen with the Tinkerbelle tool displayed, and someone changing the color of the screen using a laptop in the background**

![Lab1_D1](https://github.com/marissapang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/images/lab1_D1.MOV)

Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**In a situation where the user perhaps have a larger desk, or want the light reminders to be visible from different parts of the room, we tried to create a setup where the device has a bigger screen, using an iPad.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

![Lab1_Device](https://github.com/marissapang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/images/lab1_device.jpg)

**The three key design features I wanted the device to have are 1) visual appeal, 2) satisfying sensation when pressing the "complete task" button, and 3) durability. The idea of immediate, positive re-enforcement is frequently written about in literature discussing the formation of good habits. I hope through an aesthetically pleasing user interface, I could form a positive association between the user and their wellness habits. I also hope that the satisfying button press upon the completion of a wellness goal could serve as a small but immediate positive re-enforcement mechanism. I also sought to design a device that is durable and resistant to falls and moisture. Since the user would physically interact with the device frequently (upon the completion of different wellness goals), it is likely for the device to also be knocked off a surface or be suceptible to drink spillage.**


## Part F. Record

**Video of my prototyped interaction**

Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design.

**Fitness gadgets such as the Oura ring and Apple watch now remind users to drink water and move around. The light-based wellness reminder is inspired by these functionalities. The idea of using the color/flicker-patterns of an aesthetically pleasing light as a reminder is inspired by the programmable, color-changing LED candle lights often seen in restaurants. My brother Steven Pang helped me film the prototyped interactions**



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

## Refinements to goals & interactions made during the second iteration

### Key takeaways from the 9/9 Lab

In Part 1, the goal was for my device to act as a light-based alarm that flashes and changes color, reminding people to accomplish numerous wellness goals in an non-intrusive fashion. 

Going into the lab, I hoped to get feedback from my lab-table on the following: 
* Managing complexity - how can the device siganl effectively when one has many different wellness goals?
* Adding incentive - is there a way for me to provide some sort of positive re-enforcement mechanism that somehow accrues over time? 

My key takeaways from the lab discussion were: 
1. **\[Feedback\]** I could create more descriptive graphics than just colors and flashes (eg. animation of water for a reminder to drink water, etc)
2. **\[Learnings from teammates' ideas\]** I found myself most attracted to my teammates' ideas that involve devices that I could somehow view as more "alive" than just a computer (e.g. a light-up pet that reminds you to do certain tasks, and a chair that physically pushes you out when you've sat on it for too long). I feel like when I can think of a device as having a personality, or as having a life of its own, I feel a lot more positive emotions towards it.
3. **\[Feedback\]** It seems like most people's (in our small sample size) wellness goals can be grouped into drinking water and taking breaks (whether to look out the window, or to move around).

### Refinement of goals:
With these takeaways, I refined the goal of my device in a way that I feel like 

**Before (Goal from Pt1):** Cute, light-based alarm that flashes and changes color, reminding people to accomplish numerous wellness goals in an non-intrusive fashion. 

**Refined Goal:** Cute, animated digital fish bowl that gamifies work from home wellness goals. I hope that with a "fish bowl" (as opposed to the previous "alarm") categorization, I can bring my product closer to what I liked about devices described takeaway #2 above. 

### Refinement of setting: 
Same setting as pt 1 (desk of a single user who spends a lot of time sitting in the same spot). In the refinement, this device is more specifically designed as a cute decorative item, sort of like a little plant or teddy bear -- or actual fish bowl -- someone would put on their desk. 

![lab1_pt2_setting](https://github.com/marissapang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/images/lab1_pt2_setting.jpg)


### Refinement of activity: 
In the second iteration, I have decided limit the device to only tracking 2 wellness goals: water & breaks. Takeaway #3 above helped me feel more confident that this more prescriptive approach could work well. Inspired by feedback described in Takeaway #1 above, the device will display animated water (where water level corresponds to how much water a person drank) and fish (where the happiness and number of the fish depends on the breaks one take). 

I decided to take this idea of animated light signals one step further, and add gamification to the process. When the user drinks a lot of water, the fish could be extra happy. Or, when the user has a great streak for break taking, a rare fish could appear. On the flip side, if there is too little water or exercise, the fish would grow inanimate and eventually disappear. 

![lab1_pt2_animations](https://github.com/marissapang/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/images/lab1_pt2_animation.jpg)

### Refinement of device design
In light of the 9/9 lab discussions, the overall device specifications have not changed too much from part 1. It is still important for the device to be cute, small enough to fit well on even a small desk, fall and water resistant. 

The only aspect of the design of the device that notably changed in pt 2 is the shape of the device. Previously, the device was rectangular, and designed to be a light-based alarm clock. In this iteration, the device is not positioned as a decorative digital fishbowl. As such, it is designed to be in a cute round shape that is the same as an actual fish bowl. 


### Storyboard of user interaction with device with the refined goals and settings in mind
Key change is that, instead of getting signals from colors (like described in pt 1), the user is proactive changing the way the device looks. The user can only do one of two actions - tap once to indicate they have drank water, or tap twice to indicate that they took a break.
